# Gitquick

**Allows users to quickly add(all files), commit(with message) and push to a remote repository simply by typing**  `gitquick <'your message here'>`. 
- I believe this is useful as I often find myself tyiping `git add .` `git commit -m 'some message'` and `git push`, which gets pretty annoying if pushing a lot.
- Users should still be careful about .env files and such.
- If a repository does not exist it will prompt the user to fill in their remote repostitory link.
- I plan on using the github api to possibly create a repo straight from the cli.
